# Mall-Customers-Analysis

### Working around Unsupervised Learning with the popular Mall Customer dataset.

After analysing the features of the dataset, I saw that ‘Annual Income’ gives the clearest dispersion against ‘Spending Score’ which is what is targeted to be improved amongst customers.

Using K-Means (a partitional clustering algorithm) and the Elbow method to find the optimum number of clusters, I was able to make some inference from the now clustered data.


I also outlined two methods that can be used for the Elbow method algorithm.
