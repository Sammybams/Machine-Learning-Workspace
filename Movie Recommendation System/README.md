# Movie-Recommendation-System

### Part 1 - with Collaborative Filtering
- This is an Item-to-Item collaborative filtering model as movies rated similarly to how you rated certain movies are recommended in order of preference (i.e. best rated to least).


### Part 2 - Content Based (picking top-rated)
- I used a relative correlation between genres of movies using cosine similarity and TfidfVectorizer. Therefore, the movies that were more similar in terms of genre had a high positive correlation value.
